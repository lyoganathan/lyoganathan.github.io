## Work:

Currently I'm a data engineering analyst at SickKids (Feb 2025 - ). I work on ETL pipelines for electronic health record data.

Before that I was a data engineer at Opendoor on the MLS team (Feb 2022 - Jan 2024) and a data analyst at SiriusXM on the CRM team (March 2020 - Feb 2022).

## Academic Background:

I did my BSc. (2013-2017) and MSc. (2017-2019) in the 
[Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour](https://science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/)
at McMaster University. I worked with Dr. Nicholas Bock for my undergraduate and masters thesis.
My undergrad work involved projects like 3D printing brains from MRI data and using regression
to look at group differences in MRI metrics while controlling for variables like age, sex, BMI.
My masters research involved analyzing multi-site MRI data and comparing quantitative MRI 
to statistical methods for dealing with site effects.

I spent some summers (May-Aug 2016, 2017) in the [TIGR Lab](http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/) 
at CAMH working with Dr. Stephanie Ameis. I worked on analyzing functional brain imaging 
data such as fMRI and MEG. Projects included looking at differences in brain networks
during a task and at rest.
